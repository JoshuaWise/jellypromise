is _addStackTrace() really necessary anywhere but the Promise constructor?
add tests for .become()
add tests for PromiseStream


optimizations for index.js to import on the server only:
- make use of private handleNew/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions.
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate.
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) for Promise.all and similar functions.
- make sure to maintain the same long stack traces as with deoptimized versions.


ensure long stack traces for every way PromiseStream.closed could get rejected

add long stack trace tests



make sure all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1
