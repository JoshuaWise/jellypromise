redo lib

redo node-extensions

add optimizations for index.js to import (server only)

redo tests
redo builds

generator (seperate module?)

optimization:
- use bit field for multiple things (e.g., _state and _supressUnhandledRejections)
- use check in resolve/reject functions. instead of safety only being in closure constructions, to speed up internal methods
- use _methods instead of privately scoped functions
- find way to keep promises singly linked, to avoid each promise containing an array?
