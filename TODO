High priority:
- PromiseStreams can't be resolved with promises, so reduce's shortcut() needs to be fixed
- add tests for Promise.after
- add tests for PromiseStream


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests



Double check:
- that all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1
