add .filter/.map/.reduce/.reduceRight/.forEach for processing arrays (any shortcut API possible?)

optimization:
- add optimizations for index.js to import (server only)
- make use of private handle/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions (and add this optimization to promisify)
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate
- split Promise.partition() processing paths based on whether handler was provided

generator (seperate module?)

add utilities to README

redo tests

make sure browser-production works (require('jellypromise/production') with browserify)
