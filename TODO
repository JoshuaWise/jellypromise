High priority:
- add tests for Promise.after
- add tests for PromiseStream


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests
- maybe move references from the Promise constructor to scoped variables for internal use
  - Promise.resolve
  - Promise.after
  - Promise.isPromise
  - Promise.Stream.from



Double check:
- that all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1
