implement colors for warnings and erros, in development mode

generator (seperate module?)

optimization:
- use bit field for multiple things (e.g., _state, _deferredState, _supressUnhandledRejections)
- use check in resolve/reject functions. instead of safety only being in closure constructions, to speed up internal methods
  (and add this optimization to promisify, if this === Promise)
- use _methods instead of privately scoped functions


add optimizations for index.js to import (server only)

add utilities to README

redo tests

maybe add .filter/.map/.reduce/.each for processing arrays (any shortcut API possible?)

make sure browser-production works (require('jellypromise/production') with browserify)
