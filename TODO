High priority:
- add tests for PromiseStream


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests
- maybe move references from the Promise constructor to scoped variables for
  internal use (Promise.resolve, Promise.after, Promise.isPromise, Promise.Stream.from)
