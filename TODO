High priority (for next release):
- add tests for .become()
- add tests for PromiseStream
- is _addStackTrace() really necessary anywhere but the Promise constructor?
  if not, things like ._resolveFromHandler() can be changed to new Promise()
  in utility methods and static methods


Not as high priority:
- ensure long stack traces for every way PromiseStream could get rejected
- add long stack trace tests


Server optimizations:
- make use of private handleNew/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions.
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate.
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) for Promise.all and similar functions.
- make sure to maintain the same long stack traces as with deoptimized versions.




Double check:
- that all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1


Stream considerations:
- implement sort()
