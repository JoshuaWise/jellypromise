redo build process to create seperate lib folders, rather than browserify/compiled versions.
allow block directives (i.e., do this block for browser, do this block for node).
implement "gulp clear" to remove build materials before commiting, and add to pre-commit hook.

implement colors for warnings and erros, in development mode

generator (seperate module?)

optimization:
- use bit field for multiple things (e.g., _state, _deferredState, _supressUnhandledRejections)
- use check in resolve/reject functions. instead of safety only being in closure constructions, to speed up internal methods
  (and add this optimization to promisify, if this === Promise)
- use _methods instead of privately scoped functions


add optimizations for index.js to import (server only)

add utilities to README

redo tests

maybe add .filter/.map/.reduce/.each for processing arrays (any shortcut API possible?)
maybe switch Promise.iterate to a prototype method

make sure browser-production works (require('jellypromise/production') with browserify)
