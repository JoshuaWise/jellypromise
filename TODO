High priority (for next release):
- add tests for PromiseStream


Not as high priority:
- add long stack trace tests
- get zuul tests working


Server optimizations:
- Promise.race()
- Promise.all()
- Promise.any()
- Promise.props()
- Promise.settle()
- #finally()
- #tap()
- #become()
- #else()
- #delay()
- #timeout()
- make use of private handleNew/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions.
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) OR PromiseStream for Promise.all and similar functions.
- make sure to maintain the same long stack traces as with deoptimized versions.



Double check:
- that all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1
