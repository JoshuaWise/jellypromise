High priority:
- add tests for Promise.after
- add tests for PromiseStream


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests


Server optimizations:
- #finally()
- #tap()
- #become()
- #else()
- make use of private handleNew/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions.
- make sure to maintain the same long stack traces as with deoptimized versions.



Double check:
- that all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1
