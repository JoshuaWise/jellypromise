High priority:
- update PromiseStream docs:
  - concurrency control for .takeUntil() and .drain()
  - added index parameter to .reduce()'s callback
- add tests for PromiseStream
- reduce below 600 source characters for v8 inlining:
  - Promise.props
  - Promise.promisify
  - Promise.nodeify
- generator runner (require()'d seperately, since it requires more recent version of Node)


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests
