add long stack traces for development mode


optimization:
- add optimizations for index.js to import (server only)
- make use of private handle/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions (and add this optimization to promisify)
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate
- split Promise.partition() processing paths based on whether handler was provided
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) for optimized aggregate methods.
