High priority:
- cause unhandled rejections to crash, rather than just logging the rejection
- rework .log() to use .inspect() and to log even if the promise is rejected
- fix unhandled rejection logging in tests
- add tests for PromiseStream
- reduce below 600 source characters for v8 inlining:
  - Promise.props
  - Promise.promisify
  - Promise.nodeify
- generator runner (require()'d seperately, since it requires more recent version of Node)


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests
