add more tests
compare to bluebird tests (next: .forEach)

confirm long stack traces for .reduce (rejected/thrown immediately, or later in enumeration, or in handler)

optimizations for index.js to import on the server only:
- make use of private handle/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions.
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate.
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) for optimized aggregate methods, including Promise.all.
- make sure to maintain the same long stack traces as with deoptimized versions.

how much space would be saved in the browser if we used Promise.all for aggregate methods?

test if bluebird's async implementation is faster than asap/raw



Promise.reject(new Error()) creates redundant stack traces,
and the stack trace says they're from different events

long stack traces of warnings?

add hash links to README

maybe throw unhandled rejections in production mode?

make sure all prototype methods that generate a new, linked promise, use _handleNew, _handle, or _then, so that `this` promise sets SUPPRESS_UNHANDLED_REJECTIONS to 1

add browser test via zuul

generator (seperate module?)
