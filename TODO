add long stack traces for development mode


optimizations for index.js to import on the server only:
- make use of private handle/resolve/reject functions, instead of using new Promise() with closures, to speed up methods and static functions (and add this optimization to promisify)
- add optimized case for .catch() with single predicate
- split Promise.partition() processing paths based on whether handler was provided
- use fake promise class (e.g., PromiseArray) for optimized aggregate methods.

generator (seperate module?)

redo tests

make sure browser-production works (require('jellypromise/production') with browserify)

add hash links to README

should .forEach also have .each alias?

maybe throw unhandled rejections in production mode?
