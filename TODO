High priority:
- figure out how to give warnings when a PromiseStream is rejected with a
  non-error originating from flushIterator(), _switchToIterableMode(), or the
  source's "error" event
- add tests for PromiseStream
- reduce below 600 source characters for v8 inlining:
  - Promise.props
  - Promise.promisify
  - Promise.nodeify
- generator runner (require()'d seperately, since it requires more recent version of Node)


Not as high priority:
- get zuul tests working
- add long stack trace tests
- add more extensive memory leaks tests
